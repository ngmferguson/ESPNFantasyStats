# ESPNFantasyStats
A script to generate weekly fantasy stats for your league. The code ain't pretty, but it works.

TO GET THIS TO WORK:
Modify the GetOptimalScore method (comment explaining what)
Modify the __main__ block at the bottom to include your league info - code won't compile til you do.

Using this API: https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/wiki

If you're wondering how to find the espn_s2 and swid for a private league, this thread has info: https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/discussions/150
